## About the Project
This project, **_Blog Generator (AWS Bedrock + Lambda)_**, demonstrates a serverless generative AI application that creates blog content from a given topic. It leverages **AWS Bedrock**, **Lambda**, **S3**, **API Gateway**, and **CloudWatch** to build an end-to-end pipeline, while also highlighting how Bedrock abstracts away complex ML infrastructure to accelerate deployment.
